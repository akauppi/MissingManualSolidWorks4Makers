   - That page is from Feb 2019, preceding launch of Solidworks for Makers **by two years**. I don't think it's relevant.
   
     Also, having read that page I understand 0% of it...
     

## McMaster Carr add-in for R2023x

>I'm sorry, our add-in is not yet supported by Solidworks 23 yet. We have a team working on the add-in and it should be available early next year.

- [ ] Wait a bit. Try out in late January...

   https://www.mcmaster.com/solidworksaddin/

   - Add-in `2.0.10.0` (visible in the downloaded `.msi` name) is NOT enough for R2023x

   - Install the McMaster add-in.

   - Relaunch Solidworks Maker

   - **Expected**: A McMaster leaf is available in the right tool panel; the add-in is listed under `Tools` > `Add-ins`

>Note: The 2.0.10.0 installer succeeds - just that the add-in is not recognized by Solidworks.
