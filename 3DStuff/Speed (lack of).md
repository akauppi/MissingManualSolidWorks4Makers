# Speed (lack of)

If you (Dassault) want people to use cloud tools, they need to be **snappy**. This can be done. XBox Cloud (Beta) runs way more complex applications, in the cloud, without this much of a wait.

THIS IS NOT A LAW OF NATURE: you are just doing it wrong.

There are many places where information can - and should - be prefetched, but isn't. Too many to list. They all introduce friction to the workflow, and most can be avoided.

>Note. I'm behaving like I know this better. Perhaps, I do? :D

I'm pretty sure Dassault subcontracted cloud development to some far-away country and team. This means you are giving up on your central knowledge, and at the mercy of the competence of such a team. Too bad. Game over. Managers would become helpless in this situation, and progress stalls... Minions run the game.

*The above is purely speculation.*
