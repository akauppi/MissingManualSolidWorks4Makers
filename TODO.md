>> Is there a tutorial for people coming from SW Pro to Maker on what is and is not available? Is there a concise list of what can and can not be done in Maker version? Will I be able to open personal projects that were made in SWPro 2021 or older? Can Maker produce drawings or just 3d models?

<p />

>Maker SOLIDWORKS will open ANY file from ANY commercial SOLIDWORKS version dating all the way back to SW 95. [...] It will also open any student version file, provided that file was made with a non-3DExperience academic version of SOLIDWORKS.
