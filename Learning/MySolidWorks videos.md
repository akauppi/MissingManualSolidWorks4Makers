>Controls are *way* too small. Click the thumbnail and then `Launch in a separate window` to have a decent experience.

>**Note:** Some of the material you are not allowed to see seems a mistake. E.g. [Design Intent: Part Orientation](https://my.solidworks.com/training/master/203/design-intent-part-orientation) and [Standard Mates](https://my.solidworks.com/training/master/213/standard-mates) are on the blocked list.

<!--
Material not allowed to be seen:
- sheet metal
- structure system 
- weldings
- molds
- pipe routing    (Premium feature)
- CSWPA - exams

tbd. Check which features are there in the software.   Especially not having CSWPA information is... weird.  Dassault would only benefit from people taking those tests.

<!-- Ignored 
WIP in case the NEW (with better controls, and times visible at thumbnails) UI becomes always available.

"Crystal Reports Basics" https://my.solidworks.com/training/video/853a0a43-f40f-4426-82b2-3b31a1ffe065
   - Delmia mentioned. Likely nothing Solidworks specific.
