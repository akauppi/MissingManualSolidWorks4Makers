# Questions (Visualize)

## What does this mean?

![](.images/q-launching-visualize.md)

When launching Solidworks Visualize, I get this selection.

What does it mean?  What should I pick?  How does it affect (restrict) my later work?

**R2022x Hotfix 4.7**

**Expected**

Like Solidworks itself, the software would launch, and allow me to access any Collaborative Space, from within it.

If not, I'd like to have on-screen information about the choices.

**Actual**

No advice about what to select!!!

### Edit

The dialog does not occur on each launch. Even more weird. How do I switch work spaces?

>*Hopefully, this is gone in R2023x.*
