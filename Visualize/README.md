# Solidworks Visualize Connected

Solidworks for Makers includes Solidworks Visualize Connected. This is a separate Windows native program for creating ray-traced presentation material.

You can open Solidworks projects in Visualize, then beef the appearances etc. more than in Solidworks itself, with:

- transparent appearances
- ray-traced presentation stills

Before reading further, consider seeing this [marketing video](https://www.solidworks.com/media/3dexperience-solidworks-visualize-connected-biodapt) (5:49) that nicely lays out the tool and possible workflows.

## Installation

The sofware gets installed alongside Solidworks for Makers.

## Launching

3DExperience "compass" launcher > `Visualize`

>Hint: You can create a local shortcut, as for Solidworks itself.

## INITIAL PROBLEM - Where are my PROJECTS???

I have a Solidworks project stored in 3DExperience (= cloud). Would like to visualize it. Easy, right??

Launching Visualize I manage to see this:

>![](.images/launch-visualize-2023.png)

*Ignore the gooey project; it's from earlier tries*

Pane to the left seems to indicate I'm connected; but there is no data!

### Solution 1

By trial and error...

- `Open Project`

  - `My Content`

## Visualize project

Once you have opened the 3DExperience project (the model), you have an "untitled" project in Visualize.

By using `File` > `Save with options`, one can save to 3DExperience (cloud), with revisions.

>Note: It is a bit unclear, what is the relationship of a Visual project vs. a Solidworks model. This is *exactly* why this repo exists. Contributions welcome!!

## Workflow

You'd now go on to change appearances, and get something far more realistic than this:

## Tips: Layout

If working on a small screen (laptop), try stretching the panes. The author enjoys this setup:
