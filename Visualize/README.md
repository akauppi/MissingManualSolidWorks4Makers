# Solidworks Visualize Connected

Solidworks for Makers includes Solidworks Visualize. This is a separate binary (Windows program) for creating ray-traced presentation material.

You can open Solidworks projects in Visualize, then beef the appearances etc. more than in Solidworks itself.

E.g. transparent appearances, ray-traced presentation stills.

## Installation

The sofware gets installed alongside Solidworks for Makers.

## Launching

3DExperience "compass" launcher > `Visualize`

>Hint: You can create a local shortcut, as for Solidworks proper.

## PROBLEM 1 - Where are my PROJECTS???

I have a Solidworks project stored in 3DExperience (= cloud). Would like to visualize it. Easy, right??

Launching Visualize I manage to see this:

*Ignore the gooey project to the left; it's from a local harddisk*

Take `Recent SOLIDWORKS Documents` 

>Note: There's only `Local` grouping here, but these seem like something I've worked on, **in the cloud**.

>Likely they are the locally cached copies of what's in 3DExperience

## Layout

If working on a small screen (laptop), try stretching the panes. The author enjoys this setup:
