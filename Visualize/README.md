# Solidworks Visualize Connected

Solidworks for Makers includes Solidworks Visualize Connected. This is a separate Windows native program for creating ray-traced presentation material.

You can open Solidworks projects in Visualize, then beef the appearances etc. more than in Solidworks itself, with:

- transparent appearances
- ray-traced presentation stills

## Installation

The sofware gets installed alongside Solidworks for Makers.

## Launching

3DExperience "compass" launcher > `Visualize`

>Hint: You can create a local shortcut, as for Solidworks itself.

## PROBLEM 1 - Where are my PROJECTS???

I have a Solidworks project stored in 3DExperience (= cloud). Would like to visualize it. Easy, right??

Launching Visualize I manage to see this:

>![](.images/launch-visualize.png)

*Ignore the gooey project to the left; it's from a local harddisk*

### Solution 1

By trial and error...

- `Open Project`

  - `My Content`

  ![](.images/visualize-my-content.png)

## Visualize project

Once you have opened the 3DExperience project (the model), you have an "untitled" project in Visualize.

By using `File` > `Save with options`, one can save to 3DExperience (cloud), with revisions.

## Workflow

You'd now go on to change appearances, and get something far more realistic than this:

![](.images/rgb.png)


## Tips: Layout

If working on a small screen (laptop), try stretching the panes. The author enjoys this setup:
