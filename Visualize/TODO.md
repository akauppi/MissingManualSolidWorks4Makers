# Todo

>This is something I can check; just haven't come to do it, yet.  <!-- tbd. -->

## Are the projects linked?

If I make changes to the underlying CAD model, are those picked up in the Visualize Connected?  How does that look?  Make a section in the README.

## Can I access 3DExperience revisions?

Can I lock onto an older revision for visualization?

Haven't found any information about the cloud-based-and-versioned workflows. If Dassault helps us, let's make that into the Missing Manual. :)
